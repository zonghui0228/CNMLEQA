## 🔍 Overview

Large language models have shown strong performance in medical QA and clinical reasoning. However, standardized evaluation benchmarks in non-English medical contexts remain limited.

CNMLEQA addresses this gap by providing a clinically grounded, expert-annotated benchmark for evaluating LLM performance in Chinese medical examinations.

### Key Features

- **Clinically grounded**: Derived from real CNMLE-style questions  
- **Multidimensional annotations**: Enables fine-grained evaluation  
- **Non-English benchmark**: Focused on Chinese medical context  
- **LLM-evaluated**: Tested on state-of-the-art models

## 🧾 Annotation Schema

Each question is annotated with multi-level clinical metadata.

### Core Fields

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "question": "Question text",
  "opa": "Option A",
  "opb": "Option B",
  "opc": "Option C",
  "opd": "Option D",
  "ope": "Option E",
  "answer": "Correct option",
  "question_type": "Knowledge-based / Case-based",
  "year": "Exam year",
  "source": "Data source"
}
```

### Extended Clinical Annotations

Each question is further annotated across five clinical dimensions:

* Disease / Diagnosis
* Surgery
* Medication
* Laboratory Examination
* Symptom / Sign

All annotations were conducted and verified by clinical experts.


## 📊 Benchmark & Evaluation

We evaluated CNMLEQA using multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including:

* Gemini
* DeepSeek
* GPT series
* Qwen series
* LLaMA

Key Results

* Qwen2.5-32B: 90.88% (CNMLEQA-10k)
* DeepSeek-R1: 91.59% (CNMLEQA-3k)

Fine-tuning experiments (on Qwen models) further demonstrated significant performance improvements.
